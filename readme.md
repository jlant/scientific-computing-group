skills, learning how to program, and learning tools and techniques to help become more 
productive, efficient, and computationally sound.  
* Collaborate and share knowledge.  
* Help improve and expand computing skills.
* Learn and follow the [best practices in scientific computing].

*****
Topics
------

* [Unix Shell] - for learning basic commands/language to communicate with a computer; basis for learning how to program. 
* [Version Control with Git] - for learning how to track, reproduce, and share work efficiently.
* [Programming with Python] - for learning how to program and to write programs in a modular and testable way.
* Scientific libraries including: 
	* [numpy] - fundamental package for scientific computing; includes arrays and matrices 
	* [matplotlib] - 2-D plotting library that produces publication quality figures in various formats
	* [scipy] - package for scientific computing that includes routines for statistics, numerical differentiation, numerical 
	integration, optimization, etc. 
* And much more ...
